## Objective
High systolic blood pressure is a strong predictor of heart attacks and strokes. 
A health researcher wants to know how average systolic blood pressure varies with:

1. Age  
2. Height  
3. Weight  

For ease of interpretation, she does not wish to transform systolic blood pressure, but she is willing to consider interpretable transformations of the explanatory variables.
She thinks the trends should be relatively smooth, but not necessarily linear. She suspects that for at least some of these variables, the trends may be different for men and women.
In addition to estimating the trends, she wants to know how close observations typically are to the trend and whether the models might have any explanatory value. However, she is not interested in making predictions for individuals.
She is not interested in formal inference right now, though she may be in the future. She knows some R, so you may include R code in your report, but she can't read your mind, so label your graphs.

Use the NHANES data in the NHANES package to explore the researcher's questions. The relevant variables are:

1. BPSysAve (the average of three measurements of systolic blood pressure)  
2. Age (in years; 80 or older is recorded as 80)  
3. Weight (in kilograms)  
4. Height (in centimeters)  
5. Gender (male or female)

Please read the report for further detailed analysis.
